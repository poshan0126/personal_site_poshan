# Poshan Pandey

I write software, design AI systems, and explore how technology, art, and philosophy shape the way we think. As an engineer, I build across the full stack, from backend systems to frontend experiences, while focusing on how AI, automation, and multi-agent systems are reshaping both software and the future.

As we lean more on AI, we're losing a bit of our cognitive strength every day, so I'm building [Cogym.ai](https://cogym.ai/) — a cognitive training platform I'm developing in my free time and hope to bring into the world someday.

I'd welcome a hello at hello@poshan.com.np.

## Portfolio

*A collection of work that has shaped my journey as an engineer and observer. These projects and photographs represent my exploration of AI systems, distributed architectures, and the fleeting moments worth preserving.*

### DevSwarm
**HiVE Engineering Platform**  
Helped build and ship DevSwarm, a parallel AI coding platform enabling developers to run multiple AI assistants (Claude, Gemini, Amazon Q) concurrently across isolated Git branches. Revolutionized development workflows with HiVE (High Velocity Engineering) approach, cutting feature delivery time from 4-6 hours to under 30 minutes.

*Tech: TypeScript, Electron, Git Worktrees*

### TalentAI
**AI Talent Marketplace** | 🏆 Finalist, MIT Sloan HackNation 2025  
Revolutionary AI talent marketplace that matches candidates through debugging challenges rather than traditional interviews. Built with FastAPI, React, and LangGraph to create bias-free, skills-based evaluation using local LLMs and interactive skill visualization.

*Tech: FastAPI, React, Supabase, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Claude, OpenAI*

### ThinkFolio
**RAG Application**  
AI-powered research paper interaction platform built with Next.js 15, enabling researchers to upload PDFs and engage in intelligent conversations with academic documents. Features streaming AI chat responses with page-specific citations using RAG architecture and pgvector for semantic understanding.

*Tech: Next.js, FastAPI, Redis, OpenAI, Supabase, LangGraph, Vercel*

## Photography

Moments captured through my lens:
- **Crater Lake** - Where ancient volcanic forces carved perfection into stone, leaving behind a sapphire mirror 2,000 feet deep
- **Mount Rainier** - The mountain that stands sentinel over the Pacific Northwest, crowned in glacial ice and wrapped in morning mist
- **Trillium Lake** - Oregon's crown jewel reflected in glass-calm waters with Mount Hood
- **Seattle** - Steel and glass reaching toward clouds, the emerald city where innovation meets the endless Pacific horizon
- **Golden Gate Bridge** - Art Deco towers rising from San Francisco Bay - where engineering poetry spans the impossible in International Orange

## Philosophy

*A curated collection of thoughts that have shaped my understanding of the world.*

- "This world is cruel; therefore, I won't be." - Unknown
- "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle
- "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." - Stephen Hawking
- "In the depth of winter, I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer." - Albert Camus
