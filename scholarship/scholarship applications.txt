I am a student of BE Software from Nepal College of Information technology, Nepal. I am a good student and have decent marks in the examinations. I belong to a mediocre family. My father owns a poultry farm. He makes about 400 USD per month. That amount is just sufficient for our normal expenses. I am living in a rented room far from my home so there are added expenses. I am paying to the college by taking an education loan from a private bank. My parents are very hopeful about me and I am very eager to make their hope come true. I am very enthusiastic about machine learning, especially about Natural Language Processing. I will be very grateful if you consider me for financial aid.

I am very enthusiastic about machine learning, especially about Natural Language Processing. My minor credit project is based on a Sentiment analysis of twitter data. I am already doing a project in NLP but I want to explore more on Natural Language Processing. My teachers have inspired me a lot and they have big hopes from me. I am very intrigued by the idea and eagerly waiting to explore in this topic. Further, I am hoping to get a scholarship for the master's degree in NLP. If I get the scholarship I will do some research in NLP and contribute to the world. My career is leaned on NLP now. If I get this financial aid It will help me a lot to perform better in this field and make me eligible for the scholarship in a master's program. And I want to assure you that if I get this aid I will make everyone proud.

My family is already loaning for my study in a bachelor's degree. I cannot put more burden on their heads.
